# Graph_Coloring_Traversal

Used graph traversal theory and Welsh Powell Graph coloring algorithm to implement explicit graph structure 
and solve the problem of register allocation within compilers.

Implemented Interference Graphs. Used implict graph structure to solve the word ladder problem.
Also used explicit graph structure to find a solution for the problem of
register allocation within compilers via graph coloring.
